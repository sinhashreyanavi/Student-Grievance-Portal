</p>
We, team<b> HASHTAG</b> has taken an initiative to create an  Online Student's Grievance Support System, under the Government of Andhra Pradesh that facilitates students to lodge his or her grievance and view status on action taken with regard to their grievance(s). The basic aim of the portal is to ensure transparency in admissions, prevent unfair practices in higher educational institutions and provide a mechanism for redressal of their grievances.

The system also facilitates the universities to search and browse grievances lodged against their university and post action taken against the complaints on the portal as well as contact the complainant directly through e-mail, phone or by post.
